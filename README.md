# tommy

A simple practice project consisting of a sandbox Clojure app and a Java library.
It demonstrates a simple implementation of the observer pattern, through the simulation
of a GUI: a mock window (listener) and two buttons (broadcasters).

Might be extended in the future for the purpose of practicing various other programming 
techniques on the JVM.

## Usage

Run the -main function in main.clj, or load its functions and run them individually in the repl.
